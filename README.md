**dotfiles**
=========

My current Arch Linux setup files, main treats:

	- keyboard oriented (zsh, neovim, i3-gaps, firefox, tmux, ...)
	- minimalistic and fast
	- everything kept in the same colorscheme
	- automation focused on Python and ML (automatic code documentation, reference
  jumping, autocompletions of frameworks, folding, syntax etc.)

**Screenshots:**

*(Onscreen software: gtop, tmux, termite, neovim, fzf)*

**Installation:**

Copy appropriate configuration files to your $HOME folder. Most of them should
work out of the box, otherwise contact me.

**TO-DO:**
---------
  - Automatic installation (docker container?)
	- ML focused snippets
